## The Game

[Wiki description](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Owela?useskin=vector)

2 players play locally.
Click a cell to start your turn there. The game automatically follows the rules of playing a turn until the turn ends. You may also skip this "animation" to directly get to the end of your turn.
The other player's turn follows.
This repeats until one of the players wins, see wikipedia for more details.
